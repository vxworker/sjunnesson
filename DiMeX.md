DiMeX is an open source Arduino shield to enable the Arduino board to communicate over the DMX protocol. The idea is to be able to hang a DiMeX unit at the beginning of a line of lamp and easily control it wireless from a central control point or to add sensor directly at the line.


# Details #

It uses:<br>
digital pin <b>3</b> to send DMX signals <br>
digital pin <b>4</b> to switch between sending and receiving <br>
digital pin <b>5</b> to receive DMX signals <br>
The xbee is working just like the "standard" xbee board with the same jumper settings.<br>
