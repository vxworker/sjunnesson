= Introduction =

DiMeX is an open source Arduino shield to enable the Arduino board to communicate over the DMX protocol. The idea is to be able to hang a DiMeX unit at the beginning of a line of lamp and easily control it wireless from a central control point or to add sensor directly at the line. 


= Details =

It uses:<br>
digital pin *3* to send DMX signals <br>
digital pin *4* to switch between sending and receiving <br>
digital pin *5* to receive DMX signals <br>
The xbee is working just like the "standard" xbee board with the same jumper settings.<br>
